Experience:
I've developed a number of simple applications in class using Python, C, C++, C#, as well as some assembly. Outside of class most of my software experience comes from either personal projects or from my past internship with Northrup Grumman. During my internship I became familiar with developing applications for Windows systems using Visual Studio as well as the .NET framework. The software I wrote provided a graphical interface which allowed for the direct testing/monitoring of components designed for use with EOD robots. This software required some implementation of the CAN protocol as well as features allowing for communication over a serial connection.
