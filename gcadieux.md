# Background

I grew up in Maryville, TN, just 30 minutes south of UTK. Some languages and applications I am experienced with are:
- C
- C++
- C#
- Unity
- Unreal
- Blender
- Github
If it wasn't obvious from the languages and tools I am really into game development. I am also currently learning some front-end languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also plan on learning Python during this semester.

## Interests

Aside from my clear interest in videogames and videogame development, I also like to play the guitar or piano occasionally.  I also like to workout and run. I have lived in Germany for a year before so I also spend time studying German. Most recently, I traveled to [Vienna, Austria](https://www.austria.info/en/where-to-go/cities/vienna) during the winter.
